# lesson 3 Multilabel Classificaton and Segmentation
On **Coursera**, course of Machine learning from Andrew looks good.  
variant analysis and false positives-- `F1-SCORE` 
Often, we can get our data from kaggle.
* kaggle for dataset

turn the data into DataBunch so that we can build the model, (the structure of the net is resnet35/50 locked)

* fastai can warp quickly, `flip_vert=True` often make it perform better for planet images

Smallersize the image to get faster experiment and training  

Segmentation need to label every pixel
