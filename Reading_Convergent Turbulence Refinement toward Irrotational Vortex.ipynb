    "Fluid simulation < computer graphics  \n",
    "* first introduced by Stam 1999  \n",
    "Two main methods to **increase** the resolution of turbulence fluid:\n",
    "    * up-res: up-sampling under coarse discretization, example based methods. (post processing in this paper).  \n",
    "    * vertex-based: Aims at creating and preserving turbulence through vortivity field, two mian catigories:\n",
    "        * vorticity confinement: recover existing vortexes and enhanced them by adding mew force.  \n",
    "        * Lagrangian vortex method: build on vorticity representation of Navier-Stokes equations. Naturally divergence-free and and inherently immune to numerical dissipation. They could be implemented by surface, filaments and particles.\n",

    "This paper method: can be regarded as a vortex particle method.  \n",
    "Higher efficiency is desired in particle-based approach, particle size --> larger.  \n",
    "**Problem**： The inertia tensor being absent from equation could lead to severe numerical dissipation.  \n",
    "**Solving**： a turbulence refinned method to recover the linear velocity from missing angular velocity to enhance turbulence details.    "

    "For computing the curl of a field $A_i$ in (Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics)SPH, apply different curl formulation $$(\\triangledown\\times A_i)^{diff} = {1\\over \\rho_i}\\sum_j m_j （A_i-A_j）\\times \\triangledown_i W_{ij}$$  \n",
    "$\\rho_i$: density at the location of particle $i$.  \n",
    "$m$: mass of each particle.  \n",
    "$W$: smoothed kernel in SPH approach, we use spline kernel in experiments.  \n",
    "$\\omega$: angular velocity.\n",
    "$\\alpha$: extra relax factor, enable users to decide how rough the turbulence they desire, can be set between 0 to 1.  \n",
